## Introduction
In physics, it is known that radioactive substances lose half of their activity or mass every T_0 seconds, which is described by the following equation:

$$m(t) = m_0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / T_0}$$

You are given experimental results as n pairs of values (t, m(t)). Your task is to determine the half-life T_0.

For this task, you can use various heuristic methods or the classical linear regression method, after first transforming the data for convenience.

## Linear Regression

Let’s consider a dataset $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=0}^n$ that exhibits a linear relationship. We can model this relationship using the linear function $f(x) = ax + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the model parameters representing the slope and intercept, respectively.

The parameters of the resulting linear function can be determined by minimizing the mean squared deviation of each point from the line:

$$L(a, b) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^n\left(f(x_i) - y_i\right)^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^n\left(ax_i+b - y_i\right)^2 \rightarrow \min$$

By solving the equations $\frac{\partial}{\partial a}L(a, b) = 0$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial b}L(a, b) = 0$, one can analytically determine the values of $a$ and $b$.

## Evaluation Criteria

If your prediction is within 1% of the correct answer, you will receive 100 points. Otherwise, the result will be 0.
The final score will be calculated as the average of the scores across all test sets.
