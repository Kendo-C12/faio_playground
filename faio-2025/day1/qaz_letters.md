# Overview

The Kazakh language uses a Cyrillic-based script with 42 distinct characters, including nine unique letters. While modern computer vision often relies on large, end-to-end deep learning models, this challenge places the spotlight on expert feature engineering and classical machine learning (ML) techniques.

Participants will not work with raw image files but with a curated, pre-processed tabular dataset where the visual information of each Kazakh letter image has been distilled into a set of handcrafted, numerical features.

# Description
Your task is to build a classification model using a tabular dataset. This dataset contains a comprehensive set of features:
- Statistical Features:
 - Mean intensity: Average pixel value.
 - Standard deviation: Pixel value spread.
 - Min/Max intensity: Helps capture extremes.
 - Skewness/Kurtosis: Measures asymmetry and peakedness of intensity distribution.
 - Histogram of pixel values: Divide intensity into bins (e.g., 16 bins) and count occurrences.
- Shape-Based / Geometric Features:
  - Centroid: Center of mass of the digit.
  - Bounding box: Width, height, and aspect ratio.
  - Pixel density: Fraction of non-zero pixels.
  - Edge pixels count: Number of boundary pixels using edge detection.
  - Moments / Hu moments: 7 invariant moments describing shape, rotation, scale invariant.
  - Contours: Number of contours or contour areas using OpenCV.
  - Radial features: Distance of non-zero pixels from centroid. 
  - Fourier descriptors of contours: Shape descriptors invariant to rotation/scale.
  - Symmetry measures: Compare left-right or top-bottom halves.
- Projection / Profile Features:
 - Horizontal & vertical projections: Sum of pixel values along rows and columns.
 - Zoning features: Divide image into zones (e.g., 4x4) and calculate density in each zone.
- Transform-Based Features
 - Fourier Transform: Frequency domain coefficients.
 - Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT): Common in compression, captures low-frequency patterns.
 - Wavelet Transform: Multi-scale decomposition, capturing edges and textures.

## Files

*   **train.csv** - the training set. Contains the engineered features (e.g., f1, f2, ...) derived from the letter images, along with the true character label (target).
*   **test.csv** - the test set.  Contains the same set of engineered features, but the target column is withheld for prediction.
*   **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format.
*   **labels.csv** - supplemental information about the data.
