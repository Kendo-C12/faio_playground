🎓 **Welcome to the 2nd Round of FAIO 2025!**

Dear participant, congratulations on making it to Day 2 of our Olympiad!  
In this round, you'll face **2 new problems** that challenge your skills in computer vision and recommender systems.  
Each task is worth **1 point**. The maximum score for this round is **2 points**.

### 🧩 Problem 1 — Personalized Music Recommender
- 📄 **Task Description:** Given real-world listening data from the hitter and Izi music apps, your task is to build a system that recommends the **top 50 most relevant tracks** for each user, based on their preferences and listening history.
- 🔧 **What to do:** Develop a model that predicts which songs each user will enjoy most—and how much they’ll actually listen. You can use classical ML, deep learning, or hybrid approaches—any strategy to produce high-quality recommendations.
- 📊 **Metric:** For each test user, recommend exactly 50 tracks ranked by predicted relevance. Score: For each recommendation, record the fraction of the track listened (from 0.0 to 1.0); sum and average these values to compute the final normalized score (0.0 to 1.0).

### 🧩 Problem 2 — Lost in the Museum
- 📄 **Task Description:** Can your AI recognize a masterpiece—even when the photo is blurry, tilted, or half-cropped? You are given 20,000 images, including 10,000 high-quality gallery shots of paintings, 1,000 real-world “query” photos (blurred, cropped, poorly lit), and 9,000 distractors. Your objective is to generate **feature embeddings** for all images so that, even with drastic appearance changes, each real-world photo can be matched robustly to its correct painting in the gallery using **cross-domain image retrieval**.
- 🔧 **What to do:** Build a system that encodes each image (pixels only, no metadata) into a fixed-size feature vector. Ensure that each “query” photo is close to its genuine gallery painting in the embedding space, and far from distractors.
- 📊 **Metric:** The competition uses the **Hit@3** metric: For every query photo, if the correct gallery painting appears in the **top 3 most similar images** (via cosine similarity of embeddings), it’s counted as a hit. Final score: the fraction of query images with a correct match in the top-3 list (ranges from 0.0 to 1.0).
